# NFS-Server-Configuration
Network File Systemallows a user on a client computer to access files over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed. It's primarily used in Linux and Unix environments to share files and directories between systems on a network. 

It has the following features:

File Sharing: NFS allows for the sharing of files and directories across multiple systems on a network.

Client-Server Architecture: In NFS, the server exports file systems that are mounted by clients.

Transparent Access: Files on a remote NFS server appear as part of the clientâ€™s local file system, making the access transparent.

Centralized Data: NFS enables centralized storage and file management, which simplifies backup and file administration.

In this tutorial I will walk you through the configuration process, and provide screenshots along the way.
